<p><strong>Definitions · Agreement to applicable policies</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms for this Website. Your use of this Website means that you agree to the terms of both these documents.</p>

<p>Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of this Website This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies or sites or services run by third parties (such as Google Analytics).</p>

<p>Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Privacy Policy. Here is a table of the key terms:</p>

<p><strong>Types of information we receive from you and how we use it</strong></p>

<p>We and our service providers use your information for the legitimate purpose of operating this not-for- profit website. This information includes data (i) that you provide voluntarily and (ii) that we collect automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Information you provide voluntarily</strong></p>

<p>When you send us an email using the site’s Contact Form, you will be required to include your name and email.</p>

<p><strong>Information we receive automatically</strong></p>

<p>Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit this Website. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser’s language preference, the type and version of your device’s operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to this Website, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to this Website.</p>

<p>We use this information to enhance your experience with this Website. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with this Website, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about this Website’s demographics, and analyse trends.</p>

<p>We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data. Cookie settings can be controlled and configurated in your browser. For information about how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit Wikipedia or www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>

<p>While we never use third-party cookies, this Website, in common with many others, does use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, www.google.com (<em>&#8220;Google Analytics&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Google&#8221;</em>). Google Analytics employs cookies that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there.</p>

<p>In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension <em>&#8220;anonymizeIp&#8221;</em>. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from EU/EEA member states. Google uses this information to analyse your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to our website.</p>

<p>Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on Google’s behalf. Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly as noted elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>

<p>Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. The browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not, however, prevent information from being transmitted to us or to any other web analysis services we may at some point engage.</p>

<p>Google Analytics also uses electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single pixel gifs), which are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyse how our site is used.</p>

<p>You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on referenced above by visiting the dedicated page on Google’s website.</p>

<p>For the cases in which personal data is transferred to the United States, Google has self-certified pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>

<p><strong>We don’t sell your information</strong></p>

<p>When you contact us via the site Contact Form, we’ll use your contact information to respond to you. We won’t sell or share this info with anyone else. We may decide to offer you an option to subscribe to our newsletter. Should you decide to subscribe, you will have an option unsubscribe at any time.</p>

<p><strong>When do we share your information?</strong> <strong>If you agree</strong></p>

<p>We will share your information for a particular purpose, if you expressly agree beforehand.</p>

<p><strong>For legal reasons</strong></p>

<p>We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. If, however, we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user’s information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. Please note, however, that we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party’s request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.</p>

<p><strong>If ownership of the website is transferred (really unlikely!)</strong></p>

<p>In the unlikely event that the ownership of this Website changes, we will provide you thirty days’ notice before any personal information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>To protect you, ourselves and others</strong></p>

<p>We or our duly-appointed service providers may need to share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms or of this Privacy Policy. We may also need to access and share information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.</p>

<p>We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it’s reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, or because of similar major security or technical concerns.</p>

<p><strong>To our service providers</strong></p>

<p>As hard as we may try, we can’t do it all. So sometimes we use third-party service providers or contractors who help run or improve this Website for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors only as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services.</p>

<p><strong>How do we protect your data?</strong></p>

<p>We strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we can’t guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).</p>

<p><strong>How long do we keep your data?</strong></p>

<p>Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of this Website, and our obligations under applicable U.S. law. Non-personal information may be retained indefinitely.</p>

<p><strong>Our response to Do Not Track (DNT) requests</strong></p>

<p>While we are strongly committed to not sharing nonpublic information and Personal Information with third parties, this Website does not support Do Not Track requests. To determine whether any of the third-party services mentioned in this Policy honour <em>&#8220;Do Not Track&#8221;</em> requests, please read their privacy policies.</p>

<p><strong>Legal basis for processing personal data under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></p>

<p>The content of this Website is not specifically targeted at individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA). Consequently, donaldjenkins.com’s legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it, in the unlikely event that this Website’s content may be construed as targeting individuals in the EEA.</p>

<p>In such a context and in accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), donaldjenkins.com may process your Personal Data because:</p>

<p>we need to perform a contract with you;
you have given us permission to do so;
the processing is in our legitimate interests and is not overridden by your rights; to comply with the law.</p>

<p>If you are an individual in the EEA, by using this Website, you agree that the protection you enjoy under the terms of this Privacy Policy complies with the provisions of the GDPR Regulation. If you do not wish your use of this website to be tracked, please leave this Website and, if appropriate, leave this website to request access to and, if also desired, erasure of, any data associated with you and collected on this Website.</p>

You also understand that your information may be transferred by us and by the third parties operating our data servers from the United States to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to this privacy policy</strong></p>

<p>Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:</p>

<p>If this policy is substantively updated, we will update the text of this page and provide prior notice to you via Donald Jenkins’s Twitter feed, if possible at least thirty (30) days in advance.</p>

<p>For minor changes, including administrative or legal changes, as well as corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days’ prior notice via Donald Jenkins’s Twitter feed.</p>

<p>We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this Website after this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.
