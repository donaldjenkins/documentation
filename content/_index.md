# Documentation for donaldjenkins.com

We aim, in a modest way, to help fix the {{% quote %}}[biggest lie on the web](https://tosdr.org/en/about){{% /quote %}}: hardly anyone ever reads terms of service, and yet one agrees to them all the time. In recognition of this, we try our utmost to protect our visitors' data and privacy.

Any material change in our policies will be advertised on Donald Jenkinsâ€™s [Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/donaldjenkins). You may also wish to read the latest Policies [release notes](https://github.com/donaldjenkins/documentation/releases/).
