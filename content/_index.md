| The [Terms](/policies/terms/) are the conditions under which we welcome you to this Website \[[changelog](https://policies.donaldjenkins.com/archives/terms/changelog.html)\]. | The [Privacy Policy](/policies/privacy/) explains how we collect and process your information \[[changelog](https://policies.donaldjenkins.com/archives/privacy/changelog.html)\]. |

We aim, in a modest way, to help fix the {{% quote %}}[biggest lie on the web](https://tosdr.org/en/about){{% /quote %}}: hardly anyone ever reads terms of service, and yet one agrees to them all the time. In recognition of this, we try our utmost to protect our visitors' data and privacy.
